\section*{Abstract}
In Prechelt's ``An Empirical Comparison of Seven Programming Languages'' in {\itshape Computer}, the author compares attributes of popular programming languages. First, the author separates the programming languages into categories according to the languages' abstract properties, examining both individual languages and the categories as wholes. Then, the author compares implementations of a single program in each language. He compares run time properties of the implementations as well as the quality of the implementations and the efforts expended in producing the implementations. Finally, the author discusses trends associated with both language properties and programmer ability.
