\section*{Abstract}
In ``An Empirical Comparison of Seven Programming Languages,''\cite{Prechelt:2000:ECS:619056.621567} published in {\itshape Computer}, Prechelt compares several attributes of several popular programming languages. The author separates the programming languages being compared into categories according to the languages' abstract properties. The author examines both individual languages and the categories as wholes. The author bases his comparison on several implementations a single program. The author compares run time properties of the implementations as well as the quality of the implementations and the efforts expended in producing them. The author tests each implementation in the same test environment. He discusses several trends associated with both language properties and programmer ability.
