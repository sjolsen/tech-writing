\section*{Abstract}
In Bull et al.'s ``Benchmarking Java Against C and Fortran for Scientific Applications'' in {\itshape Proceedings of the 2001 Joint ACM-ISCOPE Conference on Java Grande}, the authors compare the performance of programming languages. The authors design the comparison to address uncertainty about the performance of these programming languages. First, the authors implement a suite of test programs in each of the tested languages. Then, the authors measure the execution time of each of these programs, controlling for factors such as execution environment and input size. Finally, the authors use these measurements to compare the performance of the tested languages.
