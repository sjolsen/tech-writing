* Abstract
- We implement the same algorithm
- in each of the languages
- report the execution times
- the strengths and weaknesses of each language

* Introduction
- The target audience for our results is younger economists or researchers [new to using computers for numerical computation]
- [the algorithm] is "representative" of many economic computations
- the two most popular environments for software development for economists
- report speed results for each language
- [We seek] to formalize [the experience of knowledgeable programmers] under well-described and explicitly controlled conditions
- do not comment on the difficulty of implementation
- the same algorithm
- without adapting [the algorithm] to the peculiarities of each language
- reflect more about our knowledge of each language than of its objective virtues
- The main point of this paper is to provide a measure of the "benefit" in a cost-benefit calculation [for choice of a language to learn]

* Results
- we did not try to take advantage of the particular features of each programming language

* Concluding Remarks
- a wide audience of researchers
