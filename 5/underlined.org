* Abstract
- comparing Java to more traditional languages such as C and Fortran
- direct performance comparison between the three languages
- a number of platforms

* Introduction
- The benchmarking effort described in this paper is intended to address precisely this issue [users' perceptions about Java's performance]
- direct performance comparisons

* The Benchmark Suite
- providing three types of benchmark
- avoid dependence on particular data sizes
- simply report execution time
- a range of execution environments
