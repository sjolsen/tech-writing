\opening{Dear Ms. Tilka:}

%% Introductory paragraph
I am writing to tell you about myself, my writing abilities, and my professional goals.
I am a research assistant in the Computer Science department at Texas State University and a senior in the undergraduate program at the same.
I am double-majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics and plan to receive my degree at the end of the Spring 2015 semester.

%% Paragraph on paper
I have some writing experience in the professional world, and my writing has been well-received.
I recently co-authored a peer-reviewed paper with one of my research colleagues, and this paper was accepted for publishing by the Association for Computing Machinery and by the Academy of Science and Engineering this summer.
As the primary author of the paper, I composed the majority of its content, and the structure and style of my writing received strong positive feedback from all reviewers.

%% Professional goals (Academia)
My personal goals for my professional career are not yet set in stone; one option I have considered is a career in academia.
As a professor, I would have the opportunity to influence in at least a small way the evolution of the relatively young field of Computer Science.
I would also have the opportunity to participate in research, with a greater degree of freedom in the focus of research than in a corporate setting.
I could also work in the discipline of Mathematics; there is no end to the number of interesting fields to study there.

%% Professional goals (Private sector)
I have also considered a career in hardware or in systems programming.
Here, I would have the advantage of much better pay than in academia.
My options would be more limited if I went into research, but I would probably enjoy work focused in design and implementation of real systems more.
An attractive aspect of this career is the proximity of several reputable technology companies; Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices have offices in Austin, while Texas Instruments is located in Dallas.

%% Professional goals (Academia cont.)
If I were to follow a career path in academia, I would first pursue graduate and doctorate education.
The primary obstacle to this path is money.
I would need either to take out loans, find scholarships to cover the costs of further schooling, or to work outside of school long enough to pay for it myself.
Of these, I consider only the second two options to be feasible; incurring any more debt than is strictly necessary is a non-starter.

This is most of the final---not necessarily the fifth---paragraph.
This a flattering closing remark.
