\opening{Dear Ms. Tilka:}

%% Introductory paragraph
I am writing to tell you about myself and my professional goals.
I am a research assistant in the Computer Science department at Texas State University and a senior in the undergraduate program at the same.
I am double-majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics and plan to receive my degree at the end of the Spring 2015 semester.

%% Paragraph on paper
I have some writing experience in the professional world, and my writing has been well-received.
I recently co-authored a peer-reviewed paper with one of my research colleagues, and this paper was accepted for publishing by the Academy of Science and Engineering this summer.
As the primary author of the paper, I composed the majority of its content, and the structure and style of my writing received strong positive feedback from all reviewers.

This is the topic sentence of the third paragraph.
This is the rest of the third paragraph...

This is the topic sentence of the fourth paragraph.
This is the rest of the fourth paragraph...

This is most of the final---not necessarily the fifth---paragraph.
This a flattering closing remark.
