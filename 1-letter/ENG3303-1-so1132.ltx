\opening{Dear Ms. Tilka:}

%% Introductory paragraph
I am writing to tell you about myself and my professional goals.
I am a research assistant in the Computer Science department at Texas State University and a senior in the undergraduate program at the same.
I am double-majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics and plan to receive my degree at the end of the Spring 2015 semester.

%% Paragraph on research
My research group focuses on ``green computing,'' a relatively new area of research in the computing field.
Our research is concerned with the energy efficiency of computers.
One aspect of my research is the energy consumption of specialized computers---computers which, unlike personal computers such as laptops and smartphones, are set to specialized tasks and are not directly controlled by a human.
I recently co-authored a paper on this subject, and this paper was accepted for publishing by the Academy of Science and Engineering this summer.

This is the topic sentence of the third paragraph.
This is the rest of the third paragraph...

This is the topic sentence of the fourth paragraph.
This is the rest of the fourth paragraph...

This is most of the final---not necessarily the fifth---paragraph.
This a flattering closing remark.
