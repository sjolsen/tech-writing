There are several varieties of pliers available for purchase.
One such choice is the familiar /slip joint pliers/, named for their two-position pivot which provides both normal and wide jaw openings.
Another choice is the broad-jawed /linemart's pliers/; these have side cutters which equips them for heavy-duty wire cutting and splicing.
Additionally, /channel-type pliers/ with multiposition pivots are available and can be adjusted to a jaw opening of up to two inches and grip any shape.
A further option is the /long-nosed pliers/, used to shape wire, shape thin metal, and cut.
One can also buy /diagonal-cutting pliers/, which have no gripping jaws and only cut.
Finally, /end cutting nippers/, also limited to cutting, able to snip wire, small nails, and brads, are available.
