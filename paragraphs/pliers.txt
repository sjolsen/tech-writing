There are several varieties of pliers available for purchase.
One such choice is the familiar {\em slip joint pliers}, named for their two-position pivot which provides both normal and wide jaw openings.
Another choice is the broad-jawed {\em linemart's pliers}; these have side cutters which equips them for heavy-duty wire cutting and splicing.
Additionally, {\em channel-type pliers} with multiposition pivots are available and can be adjusted to a jaw opening of up to two inches and grip any shape.
A further option is the {\em long-nosed pliers}, used to shape wire, shape thin metal, and cut.
One can also buy {\em diagonal-cutting pliers}, which have no gripping jaws and only cut.
Finally, {\em end cutting nippers}, also limited to cutting, able to snip wire, small nails, and brads, are available.
