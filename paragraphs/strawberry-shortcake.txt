Anyone can make strawberry shortcake.
Take on of those spongy little store-bought "cakes."
(They come six to a package.)
Fill the indentation with a spoonful of strawberries.
(Thaw them first.)
Plop on a dab of Cool Whip.
If you want to make the real thing, you have to do some work.
Make the shortcake from scratch.
Not the spongy kind, but a good drop biscuit dough.
Plenty of sugar thrown in.
Pour on the strawberries.
(Don't be stingy.)
Fresh, ripe, sliced thin, sprinkled with sugar, and left to stand for at least three hours.
Put a big scoop of natural vanilla ice cream on top.
(Homemade is best.
If it's not available, use only the finest commercial brand.)
Crown the whole thing with a thick mound of freshly whipped cream.
/That/ is strawberry shortcake.
