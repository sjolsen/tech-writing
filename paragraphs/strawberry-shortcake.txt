To make strawberry shortcake, start with a small, spongy store-bought cake.
Next, thaw some strawberries.
Then, make an indentation and fill it with a spoonful of the strawberries.
Finally, add a dab of Cool Whip.

For a better result, first make the shortcake from a good drop biscuit dough with plenty of sugar.
Second, get some fresh, ripe strawberries and slice them thinly.
Next, sprinkle the strawberries with sugar and let them stand for at least three hours.
Then, pour the strawberries onto the cake.
Next, put a big scoop of homemade or fine commercial natural vanilla ice cream on top.
Finally, crown the whole thing with a thick mound of freshly whipped cream.
